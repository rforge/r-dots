Description: Memoization can be used to speed up repetitive and computational expensive function calls.  The first time a function is called the results are stored a cache memory.  The next time the function is called with the same set of parameters, the results are momentarily retrieved from the cache avoiding repeating the calculations.  More generally, arbitrary R objects can be cached in persistent memory using a set of hashing objects.
