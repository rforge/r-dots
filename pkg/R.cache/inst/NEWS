Package: R.cache
===============

Version: 0.1.9 [2009-09-11]
o Added argument 'onError' to loadCache(), to specify the action when 
  an error occurs.  The default used to be to print the error message
  (onError="print"), but now the default is to generate a warning
  ("warning").  The other alternatives are do silently ignore it, or
  to throw the error ("error").  Except for onError="error", loadCache()
  always returns NULL if an error occurs.


Version: 0.1.8 [2009-08-11]
o ROBUSTNESS: Added sanity check to readCacheHeader() testing 
  that the read header identifier is non-empty.  This results
  in a clearer error message that before.
o Now readCacheHeader() reports the "pathname" in error/warnings
  messages, if argument 'file' refers to a file and the 
  "description" if it refers to a connection.
o CLEAN UP: Renamed the HISTORY file to NEWS.


Version: 0.1.7 [2008-02-27]
o Added option to updated the "last-modified" timestamp of cache 
  files whenever they are loaded via loadCache(). This will help
  identified what cache files have not been used for a long time.
  To turn this on, use options("R.cache::touchOnLoad"=TRUE).
o Now error messages specifies the pathname, if available.
o BUG FIX: The throw() for invalid identifiers was trying to put 
  the connection object in the output and not the identifier.


Version: 0.1.6 [2007-07-02]
o Now environments, in addition to lists, may be used as keys
  for generating cache names.
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.6.0 devel.  Minor mods.


Version: 0.1.5 [2007-03-11]
o Added getCacheRootPath() to the help index page.
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.5.0.


Version: 0.1.4 [2007-03-07]
o Added getCacheRootPath() and setCacheRootPath() to specify
  where the root of the file path is located.


Version: 0.1.3 [2007-01-24]
o Now saveCache() and loadCache() takes optional argument 'dirs' for
  caching data to subdirectories of the root cache directory.
o Added setCacheRootPath() to set the root cache directory.


Version: 0.1.2 [2006-05-25]
o Added argument 'pathname' to loadCache() in order to load
  "unknown" cache files for which the key is unknown.
o BUG FIX: Work around for not saving "promises" (non-evaluated arguments)
  in base::save(), which otherwise includes all of the surrounding 
  environment if 'sources' is not evaluated/missing.  For more details 
  see code and my email to r-devel on 2006-05-25.  Thanks to Brian Ripley
  for explaining what was going on.


Version: 0.1.1 [2006-05-22]
o Added header comment for file format > v0.1.
o Added detection of file format version.
o Added readCacheHeader().


Version: 0.1.0 [2005-12-16]
o Using a special binary file format now.  It allows you to
  check if cache is up-to-date to a source file.  If not,
  the rest of the cache binary file is not loaded.
o Added loadCache() and saveCache() methods.
o Created.
