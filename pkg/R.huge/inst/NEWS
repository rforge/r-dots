Package: R.huge
===============

Version: 0.1.9 [2009-09-22]
o DOCUMENTATION: Now the package description lists alternative packages.
o BUG FIX: From R v2.10.0, writeValues() of AbstractFileArray would give
  "Error: 4 arguments passed to .Internal(writeBin) which requires 5".
  Updated so it works with all versions of R.


Version: 0.1.8 [2009-06-11]
o Made it explicit in the title and the description that this
  package should now be considered deprecated.


Version: 0.1.7 [2009-05-20]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now open() of AbstractFileArray first tries to open the
  file for reading and updating (as before).  If that fails, then it
  tries to open the file for reading only.  It might be that the file
  is only used for reading, so if the permission allows for that but
  not updating, then open it.
o EXCEPTION HANDLING: Methods that creates/modifies files will give
  a clear error message if the file permissions does not allow it.


Version: 0.1.6 [2008-07-03]
o Moved internal readBinFragments() and writeBinFragments() to R.utils.
o No bug fixes was made in this version.
o Renamed the HISTORY file to NEWS.


Version: 0.1.5 [2006-08-29]
o Now the startup message when loading the package is generated with
  packageStartupMessage() so that it can be suppressed.
o BUG FIX: Argument 'dimOrder' of the AbstractFileArray constructor was
  not recognized causing weird results if it was intended to be in a
  non-increasing order, e.g. FileMatrix(..., byrow=TRUE).
o BUG FIX: Reading/writing data from and to a FileMatrix via 
  "["()/"[<-"() was broken. Thanks Jens Oehlschlägel for troubleshooting 
  and reporting this.
o Added private readBinFragments() and writeBinFragments().
o Added tests/ scripts.


Version: 0.1.4 [2006-05-21]
o Committed to CRAN.
o Package passed R CMD check on R v2.5.0 and R v2.6.0 devel.


Version: 0.1.3 [2006-05-09]
o Package passed R CMD check on R v2.5.0.
o Added more Rdoc comments.


Version: 0.1.2 [2006-03-14]
o Added getComments() and setComments() to AbstractFileArray.
o Added a default buffer of free bytes after the header comments.  
  This will make it easier to update the comments.  Had to change
  the file format.


Version: 0.1.1 [2006-01-28]
o Added FileVector and abstract superclass AbstractFileArray.
  The FileVector class is now used by the APS methods in
  the affxparser.extras package.


Version: 0.1.0 [2006-01-22]
o Created.  The main purpose is to provide quick and easy access
  to large number of microarray data sets.  All code is currently
  written in plain R, but will most likely be re-implemented bit
  by bit in native code to speed up the access further.  When this
  will happen I do not know.
