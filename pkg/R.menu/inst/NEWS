Package: R.menu
===============

Version: 0.3.0 [2012-10-24]
o User queries are now done via standard error.
o Now package only imports other package, not depends on them.


Version: 0.2.1 [2012-09-27]
o Now launchMenu() defaults to launching only R scripts.
o Now argument 'pattern' for textChooseFile() filters only files and
  not directories, e.g. textChooseFile("R.menu/R", pattern="[.]R$").


Version: 0.2.0 [2011-07-24]
o Added a namespace to the package, which will be more or less
  a requirement in the next major release of R.


Version: 0.1.0 [2010-01-04]
o Added launchMenu() for Package.
o Made existing launchMenu() a default method.
o Added (get|set)LaunchPath() for Package.


Version: 0.0.6 [2009-12-16]
o TYPO FIX: selectMenu() said "Select/unselect items (0 when done)",
  but one actually need to press 'q!' when done.  Thanks Pierre
  Neuvial for this report.


Version: 0.0.5 [2009-06-05]
o BUG FIX: One method called testChooseFile() not textChooseFile().


Version: 0.0.4 [2009-02-21]
o Added textChooseDir() for choosing directories.
o Renamed textSelectFile() to textChooseFile().
o BUG FIX: Forgot to reorder paths when reordering the options
  in textSelectFile().


Version: 0.0.3 [2009-02-13]
o Now textSelectFile() lists directories first (with trailing slash),
  then the files.  Both sets are sorted in lexicographic order.


Version: 0.0.2 [2009-02-12]


Version: 0.0.1 [2009-02-12]
o Created by putting a lot of old scripts into a package.
