Package: R.menu
================

Version: 0.0.5 [2009-06-05]
o BUG FIX: One method called testChooseFile() not textChooseFile().


Version: 0.0.4 [2009-02-21]
o Added textChooseDir() for choosing directories.
o Renamed textSelectFile() to textChooseFile().
o BUG FIX: Forgot to reorder paths when reordering the options
  in textSelectFile().


Version: 0.0.3 [2009-02-13]
o Now textSelectFile() lists directories first (with trailing slash),
  then the files.  Both sets are sorted in lexicographic order.


Version: 0.0.2 [2009-02-12]


Version: 0.0.1 [2009-02-12]
o Created by putting a lot of old scripts into a package.
