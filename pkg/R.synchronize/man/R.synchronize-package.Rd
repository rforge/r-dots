 \description{
   This package provides platform-independent classes and methods for synchronizing code execution across multiple hosts, e.g. mutex.  NOTE: This package is very much in an alpha stage, and will definitely be updated alot before there is a stable API.

   This package should be considered to be in an alpha phase.
   You should expect the API to be changing over time.
