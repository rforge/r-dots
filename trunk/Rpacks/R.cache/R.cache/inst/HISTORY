Package: R.cache
===============

Version: 0.1.5 [2007-03-11]
o Added getCacheRootPath() to the help index page.
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.5.0.


Version: 0.1.4 [2007-03-07]
o Added getCacheRootPath() and setCacheRootPath() to specify
  where the root of the file path is located.


Version: 0.1.3 [2007-01-24]
o Now saveCache() and loadCache() takes optional argument 'dirs' for
  caching data to subdirectories of the root cache directory.
o Added setCacheRootPath() to set the root cache directory.


Version: 0.1.2 [2005-05-25]
o Added argument 'pathname' to loadCache() in order to load
  "unknown" cache files for which the key is unknown.
o BUG FIX: Work around for not saving "promises" (non-evaluated arguments)
  in base::save(), which otherwise includes all of the surrounding 
  environment if 'sources' is not evaluated/missing.  For more details 
  see code and my email to r-devel on 2006-05-25.  Thanks to Brian Ripley
  for explaining what was going on.

  check if cache is up-to-date to a source file.  If not,
  the rest of the cache binary file is not loaded.
o Added loadCache() and saveCache() methods.
o Created.
