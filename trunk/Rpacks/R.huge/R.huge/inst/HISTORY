Version: 0.1.2 [2006-03-14]
o Added getComments() and setComments() to AbstractFileArray.
o Added a default buffer of free bytes after the header comments.  
  This will make it easier to update the comments.  Had to change
  the file format.

  The FileVector class is now used by the APS methods in
  the affxparser.extras package.


Version: 0.1.0 [2006-01-22]
o Created.  The main purpose is to provide quick and easy access
  to large number of microarray data sets.  All code is currently
  written in plain R, but will most likely be re-implemented bit
  by bit in native code to speed up the access further.  When this
  will happen I do not know.
