Package: R.huge
===============

Version: 0.1.5 [2006-08-22xx]
o BUG FIX: Argument 'dimOrder' of the AbstractFileArray constructor was
  not recognized causing weird results if it was intended to be in a
  non-increasing order, e.g. FileMatrix(..., byrow=TRUE).
o BUG FIX: Reading/writing data from and to a FileMatrix via 
  "["()/"[<-"() was broken. Thanks Jens Oehlschlägel for troubleshooting 
  and reporting this.
o Added private readBinFragments() and writeBinFragments().


Version: 0.1.4 [2006-05-21]
o Committed to CRAN.
o Package passed R CMD check on R v2.5.0 and R v2.6.0 devel.


Version: 0.1.3 [2006-05-09]
o Package passed R CMD check on R v2.5.0.
o Added more Rdoc comments.


Version: 0.1.2 [2006-03-14]
o Added getComments() and setComments() to AbstractFileArray.
o Added a default buffer of free bytes after the header comments.  
  This will make it easier to update the comments.  Had to change
  the file format.


Version: 0.1.1 [2006-01-28]
o Added FileVector and abstract superclass AbstractFileArray.
  The FileVector class is now used by the APS methods in
  the affxparser.extras package.


Version: 0.1.0 [2006-01-22]
o Created.  The main purpose is to provide quick and easy access
  to large number of microarray data sets.  All code is currently
  written in plain R, but will most likely be re-implemented bit
  by bit in native code to speed up the access further.  When this
  will happen I do not know.
