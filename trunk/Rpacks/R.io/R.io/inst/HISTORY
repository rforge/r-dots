Package: R.io
=============

Version: 0.38 [2008-03-06]
o BUG FIX: Regular expression pattern 'a-Z' is illegal on (at least) 
  some locale, e.g. 'C' (where 'A-z' works). The only way to specify 
  the ASCII alphabet is to list all characters explicitly, which we now
  do in all methods of the package.  See the r-devel thread 
  "invalid regular expression '[a-Z]'" on 2008-03-05 for details.


Version: 0.37 [2008-01-15]
o BUG FIX: printDl() of HtmlPrintStream called onLi() instead
  of onDd() internally.
o BUG FIX: printList() of HtmlPrintStream called onLi() with
  an non-existing argument 'index'. Same for onDd().
o BUG FIX: writeFigure() of HtmlReporter used a non-existing
  variable internally.
o BUG FIX: example(RspEngine) would give an error on recent
  versions of R.
o Package passes R CMD check on R v2.6.1.
  No tests and no promises are done for version before that. 


Version: 0.36 [2007-05-09]
o Package now passes R CMD check on R v2.5.0.
o Replaced all deprecated trycatch() with tryCatch().
o BUG FIX: The example for HtmlPrintStream did not generate
  valid HTML colors for the HTML table under R v2.5.0.


Version: 0.35 [2005-08-02]
o The RspEngine and RspException classes are now deprecated. Use the
  R.rsp package instead.


Version: 0.34 [2005-05-31]
o Package now depends on the new R.utils package. 
o Several classes and methods has now been deprecated: 
  - File, FileFilter, RegExprFileFilter, FileException, FileExistsException,
    FileNotFoundException, and getTargetPathname(). Use file functions
    R.utils instead.
  - readJavaXXX() and writeJavaXXX() functions. Use Java in R.utils.
o Moved readWindowsShortcut() to R.utils.
o Moved sourceTo() to R.utils and removed the argument 'expandShortcuts'.

Version: 0.33 [2005-05-03]
o Removed unnecessary dependancy on R.colors from DESCRIPTION.

Version: 0.32 [2005-03-09]
o Added arguments 'recursive' and 'pattern' to listDir(). 
o Remove argument 'filter' from listFiles(). This is passed to listDir()
  by '...' instead. 

Version: 0.31 [2005-02-25]
o Now isDirectory(File("C:/")) returns TRUE.
o Removed debug message that occured when loading R.io.
o Update the File class to recognize C:/ as a directory.

Version: 0.30 [2005-02-20]
o Minor fixes to work with the new R.oo package.

Version: 0.29 [2005-02-10]
o Moved the Java class to the R.matlab package since it currently
  used there.

Version: 0.28 [2005-01-18]
o Added get- and setOnStart() to LaTeXReporter.
o Updated getVerbatim() in Reporter to utilize print() instead.

Version: 0.27 [2004-10-21]
o Updated the Reporter classes; Added begin*(), end*() and 
  write*() to several "tags". Remove argument 'height' from
  writeImage() again. Width and height is now handled by 
  Device$print() as it should. 
o Added sourceTo() to source() a file to a given environment.
o Now File accepts any number of pathname components. 
o Added readWindowsShortcut() to read and parse Microsoft Windows
  Shortcut files.
o Added getTargetPathname() to read and parse Microsoft Windows
  Shortcut files to the target pathname.
o Added argument 'expandShortcuts' to constructor and method 
  getAbsolutePath() such that Microsoft Windows Shortcut files are 
  followed. All related methods recognizes the expansion if a File 
  object's 'expandShortcuts' field is TRUE. If there exists a "data.lnk"
  Windows Shortcut file, both File("data.lnk") and File("data") will
  expand it.
o BUG FIX: 'Object "s" not found' error in pushTag() of HtmlPrintStream.

Version: 0.26 [2004-07-01]
o BUG FIX: The sub- and subsubsection counters were not reset 
  when a new section was created. Updated HtmlReporter and
  TextReporter.
o Now the CSS destination directory used by HtmlReporter is
  created if missing. In previous versions the CSS file would
  not be copied if the directory was missing when the reporter
  was opened.
o BUG FIX: The example of the RspExample used paste() instead of 
  file.path().
o Added setIncludePath(), include(), pushRedirect(), popRedirect(), 
  writeWarning(), writeError(), getExtension(), writeImage(),
  beginFigure(), endFigure() to the Reporter class(es).

Version: 0.25 [2004-03-02]
o BUG FIX: Starting with R v1.8.1, strsplit(x) will not anymore 
  make x <- as.character(x) internally. Thus strsplit(NULL) etc
  generated errors. Updated HTMLPrintStream$escape() accordingly.

Version: 0.24 [2003-12-31]
o BUG FIX: File(NULL, child) would give an error. Now it is identical
  to File(child) as expected.

Version: 0.23 [2003-12-16]
o Added the IOException, FileException, FileNotFoundException 
  and FileExistsException classes.

Version: 0.22 [2003-10-19]
o Added support to extract more than just the last extension 
  of a filename. See File's getExtension() and argument 'last=1'.

Version: 0.21 [2003-04-21]
o Replaced all occurances of getClass() with data.class().

Version: 0.20 [2003-01-16]
o Added static constants to the Java class for minimum and maximum values
  of some of the Java data types, e.g. LONG.MIN and SHORT.MAX.
o Added executable example code for the Java class. This was mainly
  to have some test code that would make sure that bugs are not 
  introduced with new version.
o BUG FIX: readShort() of the Java class did not return integers (as it
  could), i.e. is.integer() would return FALSE. Also, readShort() 
  returned 32768 when it read -32768. readInt() did inherit an analogue
  problem for the smallest possible integer.
o BUG FIX: Java$writeUTF() and Java$readUTF() was broken because I forgot
  to update the code to call the write/read methods as static methods as
  introduced 2002-10-23 (see below). Thanks Toby Patterson at CSIRO in
  Hobart for reporting the problem with the Matlab server/client code, 
  that lead to this bug fix.

Version: 0.19 [2003-01-07]
o BUG FIX: listDir() in the class File, which is used by listFiles(), did
  give an error if the directory was empty and a FileFilter object was to 
  be applied.
o BUG FIX: accept() of RegExprFileFilter now returns FALSE if pathname
  is NULL.
o writeEquation() of HtmlReporter now tries to convert LaTeX symbols and
  commands into valid HTML characters. Note that some characters might not
  be supported by some browser, e.g. greek letters.
o writeTable() of all Reporter classes will now follow getOption("digits")
  if nothing else is specified.
o Added method add() to MultiReporter to make it possible to add Reporter
  one by one and not only at construction time.

Version: 0.18 [2002-12-19]
o Added writeEquation() to the Reporter classes and made TextReporter and
  LateXReporter to generate better tables and lists.
o Added finalize() to the Reporter class, meaning that if one forget
  to close an Reporter object, but it eventually will cleanup by the
  garbage collection any reserved connection will be released.
o Added writeAndEvaluateCode() and protected getVerbatim() to the Reporter
  class.
o Updated the writeVerbatim() methods to make use getVerbatim(), which
  should guarantee that the output from all writeVerbatim() should be
  the same.
o Added trial version of the LaTeXReporter class.
o Added writeList() to all Reporter classes.
o printList() of HtmlPrintStream does not print empty item names anymore. 
o BUG FIX: Internal bugs in writeTable() for HtmlReporter. Should
  work better now.
o BUG FIX: toURLEncodedPath() did incorrectly encode "-" as "2%D". This 
  was due to an incorrect usage of regexpr(). Furthermore, the argument
  'encodeUrlSyntax=FALSE' was added.
Version: 0.17 [2002-10-23]
o Added support for the RSP <%# %> tag for the RSPEngine. This tag
  is the same as <% %> except that it also outputs the code to the
  HTML document.
o Added the Java class, which should contain static methods for all
  Java related importing and exporting of data types etc.
  Kept the writeJavaInt() et al for backward compatibility, but the
  are deprecated and *will* be removed.
o Renamed the HTML* classes to Html* to comply with the RCC rules.
o Added the methods show() and chooseFile() to File.
o Updated the package to comply to the new Object class.

Version: 0.16 [2002-09-03]
o Added writeJavaByte(), writeJavaShort(), writeJavaInt() and
  writeJavaUTF() and the corresponding read methods. Currently
  readJavaUTF() only supports plain ASCII sequences.

Version: 0.15 [2002-07-03]
o Added .conflict.OK to minimize number of message during loading. 

Version: 0.14 [2002-05-26]
o Package now passes the R CMD check with 5 warnings.
o Minimized the number of warnings when loading packages.

Version: 0.13 [2002-05-21]
o BUG FIX: toURL() in class File returned "file:/" instead of "file://".

Version: 0.12 [2002-05-05]
o Implemented a working [R] Server Pages (RSP) engine. Wow ;)
  It also create nice RSPException messages.
  See class RSPEngine for more information.

Version: 0.11 [2002-04-07]
o Added hasEndTag() to HTMLPrintStream and made printTag() lookup up
  if a end tag is need or not if 'endTag=NULL'. This makes life easier
  and basically one does not have to think about setting endTag or not.

Version: 0.10 [2002-04-03]
o Argument 'child' in constructor of File can now also be a File object.

Version: 0.9 [2002-04-02]
o Renamed HTMLImageRotator to HTMLRotatableImage and made some redesign
  of it so it is not dependent on an HTMLPrintStream.
o Finally this package also passes Rcmd check.
o Added isOpen() to ConnectionInputStream and ConnectionOutputStream.
o BUG FIX: close() in ConnectionInputStream did give an error if called
  more than once.

Version: 0.8 [2002-03-26]
o Added trial version of class HTMLImageRotator.
o Added Rdoc comments and an extensive example for Reporter.
o Improved the speed and the control of each cell written by
  writeTable in class HTMLOutputStream.

Version: 0.7 [2002-03-05]
o Improved the HTMLOutputStream.
o Added the class BufferedOutputStream.
o The argument pathname in the accept() method of FileFilter's should
  now accept any kind of objects. If the class is unknown, 
  as.character() will be used.
o Added full support for FileFilter's in listDir() and listFiles().
o Added help pages for a lot of the classes.
o Implemented mkdirs() in File and made some minor updates in 
  the code for other File methods.

Version: 0.6 [2002-01-24]
o Updated HTMLPrintStream and MultiOutputStream.
o Added Reporter, HTMLReporter, TextReporter, MultiReporter.

Version: 0.5 [2002-01-21]

Version: 0.4 [2001-08-04]

Version: 0.3 [2001-07-17]

Version: 0.2 [2001-05-06]

Version: 0.1 [2001-04-30]
