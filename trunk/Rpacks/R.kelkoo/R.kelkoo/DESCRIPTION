Description: This package provides methods for querying Kelkoo.com for flights.  One can specify all flight details as on the webpage, but also specify a set of dates for the outbound and the homebound flights to automate the process of searching for optimal flights during a certain period.  The results are given in a tab-delimited file that can be further processed in a spreadsheet application.
