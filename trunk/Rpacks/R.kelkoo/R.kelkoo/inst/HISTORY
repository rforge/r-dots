Package: R.kelkoo
=================

Version: 0.2.2 [2007-07-23xx]
o Added support for specifying number of adults, children, and babies.
o Now the heatmaps in the reports are covering values in
  quantiles [0,0.99].  Higher heatmap values are truncated 
  to the 99% quantile.  This way the color range will be
  robust against extreme outliers.
o BUG FIX: Updated path reports/.rsp/ to <getRootPath()>/.rsp/.
