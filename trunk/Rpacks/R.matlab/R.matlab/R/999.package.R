# @RdocPackage R.matlab
#
# \description{
#   @eval "getDescription(R.matlab)"
#
#   In brief, this package provides a one-directional interface from 
#   \R to Matlab, with communication taking place via a TCP/IP connection 
#   and with data transferred either through another connection or via 
#   the file system. On the Matlab side, the TCP/IP connection is handled
#   by a small Java add-on.
#
#   The methods for reading and writing MAT files are stable. 
#   The \R to Matlab interface, that is the Matlab class, is less 
#   prioritized and should be considered a beta version.
#
#   For package history, see \code{showHistory(R.matlab)}.
# }
#
# \section{Requirements}{
#   This is a cross-platform package implemented in plain \R.
#   This package depends on the \pkg{R.oo} package [1].
#
#   To use the Matlab class or requesting verbose output messages, the 
#   \link[R.utils:R.utils-package]{R.utils} package is loaded 
#   when needed (and therefore required at in those cases).
#
#   The \code{readMat()} and \code{writeMat()} methods do \eqn{not} require a 
#   Matlab installation neither do they depend on the Matlab class.
#
#   To connect to Matlab, Matlab v6 or higher is required.
#   It does \emph{not} work with Matlab v5 or before (because there those 
#   version does not support Java).
#   For confirmed Matlab versions, see @see help on the "Matlab" class.
# }
#
# \section{Installation}{
#   To install this package do\cr
#
#   \code{install.packages("R.matlab")}
#
#   Required packages are installed in the same way.  
#
#   To get the "devel" version, see \url{http://www.braju.com/R/}.
# }
#
# \section{To get started}{
#   To get started, see:
#   \enumerate{
#     \item @see "readMat" and @see "writeMat" - For reading and writing MAT files (Matlab is \emph{not} needed).
#     \item @see "Matlab" - To start Matlab and communicate with it from \R.
#   }
# }
#
# \section{Miscellaneous}{
#   A related initiative is \emph{RMatlab} by Duncan Temple Lang
#   and Omegahat.  It provides a bi-directional interface between the
#   \R and Matlab languages. For more details, see 
#   \url{http://www.omegahat.org/RMatlab/}. 
#   To call R from Matlab on Windows (only), see \emph{MATLAB R-link} 
#   by Robert Henson available at the Matlab Central File Exchange 
#   (\url{http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=5051}).

# \section{How to cite this package}{
#   Whenever using this package, please cite [2] as\cr
#
#   @howtocite "R.matlab"
# }
#
# \section{Troubleshooting}{
#   \bold{In general}:\cr
#   For trouble shooting in general, rerun erroneous function with
#   verbose/debug messages turned on. For \code{readMat()} and \code{writeMat()}
#   see their help. For communication with a Matlab server, use
#   \preformatted{
#    matlab <- Matlab()
#    setVerbose(matlab, threshold=-2)
#   }
#   The lower the threshold is the more information you will see.\cr
#
#   \bold{Cannot connect to Matlab}:\cr
#   If R fails to connect to Matlab, make sure to try the the example in 
#   help(Matlab) first.  Make sure that the Matlab server is running
#   before trying to connect to it from R first.  If Matlab is running
#   but \code{open()} times out, make sure Matlab is listening to the
#   same port that R is trying to connect to.  If that does not help,
#   try to increase the time-out limit, see help(open.Matlab).\cr
#   
#   \bold{Expected an 'answer' from Matlab, but kept receiving nothing.}:\cr
#     When spawning a really long Matlab process by \code{evaluate()}, you
#   may get the above error message.\cr
#   \emph{Reason:} This happens because \code{evaluate()} expect a reply 
#   from Matlab as soon as Matlab is done. The waiting should be "blocked",
#   i.e. it should wait until it receives something. For unknown reasons, 
#   this is not always happening. The workaround we have implemented is to
#   try \code{readResult/maxTries} waiting \code{readResult/interval} seconds
#   inbetween.\cr
#   \emph{Solution:}
#   Increase the total waiting time by setting the above options, e.g.
#   \preformatted{
#    setOption(matlab, "readResult/interval", 10); # Default is 1 second
#    setOption(matlab, "readResult/maxTries", 30*(60/10)); # ~30 minutes
#   }
# }
#
# \section{Wishlist}{
#  Here is a list of features that would be useful, but which I have
#  too little time to add myself. Contributions are appreciated.
#  \itemize{
#    \item Add a function, say, \code{Matlab$createShortcut()} which
#          creates a Windows shortcut to start the Matlab server
#          by double clicking it. It should be possible to create
#          it in the current directory or to the Desktop.
#          Maybe it is possible to do this upon installation and
#          even to a Start -> All Programs -> R menu.
#    \item To improve security, update the MatlabServer.m script to
#          allow the user to specify a "password" to be send upon
#          connection from R in order for Matlab to accept the 
#          connection. This password should be possible to specify
#          from the command line when starting Matlab. If not given,
#          no password is required. 
#    \item Add additional methods to the Matlab class. For instance,
#          inline function in Matlab could have its own method.
#    \item Wrap up common Matlab commands as methods of the Matlab 
#          class, e.g. \code{who(matlab)}, \code{clear(matlab)} etc.
#          Can this be done automatically using "reflection", so
#          that required arguments are automatically detected?
#    \item Add support for reading (and writing) sparse matrices
#          to be represented by the sparse matrix class defined in
#          the \code{SparseM} package.
#    \item Add access to Matlab variables via \code{"$"} and 
#          \code{"$<-"}, e.g. \code{matlab$A} and 
#          \code{matlab$A <- 1234}. Is this wanted?
#          Maybe the same for functions, e.g. \code{matlab$dice(1000)}.
#          Is it possible to return multiple return values? 
#  }
#
#  If you consider implement some of the above, make sure it is not
#  already implemented by downloading the latest "devel" version!
