Package: R.native
=================

Version: 0.1.3 [2007-08-20]
o Removed argument 'na.rm' from rowQuantiles() since it still don't
  support missing values. 


Version: 0.1.2 [2006-11-07]
o Added documentation to all methods and classes.
o Package now passes R CMD check.


Version: 0.1.1 [2005-12-07]
o BUG FIX: When calculating the median of a row with an even number 
  non-NA values, the length of the second sort was one element too
  short, which made rowMedians to freeze R.


Version: 0.1.0 [2005-11-25]
o Added rowMedians() and rowQuantiles().
o Created this package. This package will contain methods calling
  native code.  The reason for this is performance.  The drawback
  is that it will not install out of the box on any machine.
